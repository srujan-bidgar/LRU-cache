# LRU-cache

Demonstrating caching algorithms

# Why its required
- learning software developmemt cycle
> unit testing,designing & coding
- learning how caching algorithms work

# Features
**Eviction Policy:** A set algorithm which determines which element is removed incase the capacity of cache is exceeded.

# Learnings
- [x] Cache and its internal implementation
- [x] Eviction policy and its application
- [x] How to come up with optimized code for a solution with less time complexity.
- [x] A deeper understanding of how classes are implemented

# Challenges
- [x] Making sure current functionality doesn't break while adding new features
(solution : testing and different testcases in the following push commands)
- [x] Avoiding repeated code (solution : analyse and create a single function for common feature)
- [x] Working on time complexity for put function ( O(n) to O(log n) )
